# Inline Editing and Comprehensive Logging Features

## Overview
This document outlines the new inline editing capabilities and comprehensive logging system implemented for the KCCA Performance Management Information System (PMIS).

## Features Implemented

### 1. Inline Editing Capabilities

#### Performance Indicators
- **Current Value Editing**: Users can now edit current values directly in the list view without opening individual records
- **Real-time Updates**: Achievement percentages and status are automatically recalculated when values are updated
- **Automatic Actions**: Performance actions are automatically created when values are updated via inline editing

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Current Value Editing**: Direct editing of current values in the list view
- **Status Updates**: Automatic status calculation based on achievement percentages
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All changes are logged in both chatter and audit logs

#### PIAP Actions
- **Status Updates**: Inline editing of action status (Not Started, In Progress, Completed, On Hold, Cancelled)
- **Progress Updates**: Direct editing of progress percentages with visual progress bars
- **Change Tracking**: All status and progress changes are tracked and logged

### 2. Comprehensive Logging System

#### Chatter Integration
All models now include enhanced chatter logging with:
- **Detailed Change Information**: Shows old and new values for all changes
- **User Attribution**: Records who made the change and when
- **Rich Formatting**: HTML-formatted messages with clear before/after comparisons
- **Automatic Timestamps**: Precise timestamp recording for all changes

#### Audit Log System
A new dedicated audit logging system provides:

##### Audit Log Model (`audit.log`)
- **Complete Change History**: Records all changes across the system
- **User Tracking**: Tracks which user made each change
- **IP Address Logging**: Records the IP address of users making changes
- **Session Tracking**: Links changes to user sessions for security
- **Field-Level Changes**: Tracks specific field changes with old and new values
- **Context Information**: Records related programme and directorate information

##### Audit Log Features
- **Searchable History**: Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- **Time-based Filtering**: Filter by today, this week, this month
- **Action Type Filtering**: Filter by create, update, delete, approve, etc.
- **Model-specific Filtering**: Filter by specific models (Performance Indicators, KPIs, PIAP Actions)
- **User-based Filtering**: Filter by specific users
- **Export Capabilities**: Export audit logs for compliance and reporting

### 3. Enhanced List Views

#### Performance Indicator List View
```xml
<list editable="bottom">
    <field name="current_value" class="oe_edit_only"/>
    <!-- Other fields are read-only -->
</list>
```

#### Key Performance Indicator List View
```xml
<list editable="bottom">
    <field name="current_value" class="oe_edit_only"/>
    <!-- Other fields are read-only -->
</list>
```

#### PIAP Action List View
```xml
<list editable="bottom">
    <field name="status" class="oe_edit_only"/>
    <field name="progress" widget="progressbar" class="oe_edit_only"/>
    <!-- Other fields are read-only -->
</list>
```

### 4. Automatic Performance Tracking

#### Performance Actions
When performance indicator values are updated via inline editing:
- **Automatic Performance Action Creation**: Creates a performance action record
- **Auto-approval**: Inline edits are automatically approved
- **Performance Score Creation**: Creates corresponding performance score records
- **Achievement Calculation**: Automatically calculates and updates achievement percentages

#### Audit Trail
Every change creates:
- **Audit Log Entry**: Detailed record in the audit log system
- **Chatter Message**: User-friendly message in the record's chatter
- **Performance Action**: For performance-related changes
- **Performance Score**: For value updates

### 5. Security and Compliance

#### Access Control
- **Read-only Audit Logs**: Audit logs cannot be edited or deleted by users
- **Role-based Access**: Different access levels for different user roles
- **Secure Logging**: All changes are logged regardless of user permissions

#### Compliance Features
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Every change is recorded with full context
- **User Attribution**: All changes are attributed to specific users
- **Timestamp Accuracy**: Precise timestamps for all changes
- **IP Address Tracking**: Security tracking of user locations
- **Session Management**: Links changes to user sessions

### 6. User Experience Improvements

#### Visual Indicators
- **Progress Bars**: Visual progress indicators for PIAP actions
- **Status Colors**: Color-coded status indicators
- **Achievement Indicators**: Visual achievement percentage displays

#### Ease of Use
- **Single-click Editing**: Click once to edit values directly in the list
- **Automatic Saving**: Changes are saved automatically
- **Real-time Updates**: Computed fields update immediately
- **Error Prevention**: Validation prevents invalid data entry

## Technical Implementation

### Models Enhanced
1. **Performance Indicator** (`performance.indicator`)
2. **Key Performance Indicator** (`key.performance.indicator`)
3. **PIAP Action** (`piap.action`)
4. **Output** (`output`)
5. **Intervention** (`intervention`)

### New Models Added
1. **Audit Log** (`audit.log`)

### Key Methods Implemented
- `write()` method overrides for comprehensive logging
- `log_action()` method for creating audit entries
- `log_field_change()` method for field-specific logging
- Automatic performance action creation
- Real-time achievement calculation

### Views Updated
- List views made editable with selective field editing
- Enhanced form views with better chatter integration
- New audit log views with advanced filtering
- Dashboard integration for audit log access

## Usage Instructions

### For End Users
1. **Editing Values**: Click on the current value field in any list view to edit directly
2. **Viewing Changes**: Check the chatter tab to see all changes made to a record
3. **Tracking History**: Use the Audit Logs menu to view system-wide changes

### For Administrators
